I'm excited to share a glimpse of an endeavor I've been pouring my heart into. It's a blend of my personal journey and a project aimed at making English learning more intuitive for non-native speakers(Currently Mandarin Speakers).

🌍 Leveraging AI, I've built a functional tool that offers a fresh approach to English learning. Picture a supportive, AI-enhanced English guide, ready to journey with you.

💡 While the foundation is set and I have a working model, there's always room for refinement. Your insights can be the catalyst for that!

📖 you'll find my personal space that houses this project, showcasing its workflow, some sample demos, and a bit more about my journey.

Stay tuned for updates and improvements. And of course, your feedback is gold to me.
